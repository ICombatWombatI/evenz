            allegedly infringing content, with your contact details, in order for that person to be able to contact you and challenge
            your claim.

            If we’ve removed or disabled access to content that you submitted, pursuant to a notification of claimed infringement that
            we received, then you have an opportunity to respond to the notice and takedown by submitting a counter-notification
            to our Agent. To be effective, your counter notification must be a written communication that includes substantially
            the following:
            <br>

                has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before its removal or before access to it was
                disabled;
              </div>

                A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result
                of mistake or misidentification of the content;
              </div>
              <br>
              <div style="display: flex">
                <div style=" margin-right:10px">(4)</div> Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you
                consent to the jurisdiction of the competent courts in any judicial district in which your address is located
                or in which you may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification
                or an agent of such person.

            After receipt of a counter notification, we will provide the person who submitted the claimed infringement notification, with a copy of
            the counter notification. 
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Subject to the applicable law, we may then replace the removed content and cease disabling
            access to it within 10 to 14 business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless our Agent first receives
            notice from the person who notified us of the claimed infringement that such person has filed an action seeking
            a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on the Service.

            We may terminate your user account on the Service if we, at our sole discretion, determine that you are a repeat infringer.
            A repeat infringer is a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice or a user whose submitted
            content was removed from the Service more than twice.

            <br>

             We may decide, at our sole discretion, that a sufficient
            reason exists for the immediate termination of your account for any reason, at any time. In these cases, we may
            terminate your account immediately.
